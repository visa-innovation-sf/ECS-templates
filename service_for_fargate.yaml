    Default: 80
    Description: What port number the application inside the docker container is binding to

  ContainerCpu:
    Type: Number
    Default: 256
    Description: How much CPU to give the container. 1024 is 1 CPU

  Cluster:
    Type: String
    Description: The name of the Fargate Cluster.

    Default: 512
    Description: How much memory in megabytes to give the container

  VpcId:
    Type: AWS::EC2::VPC::Id

    Description: Select at two subnets in your selected VPC.

  Path:
    Type: String
    Default: "*"
    Description: A path on the public load balancer that this service
                 should be connected to. Use * to send all load balancer
                 traffic to this service.
  Priority:
    Type: Number
    Default: 1
    Description: The priority for the routing rule added to the load balancer.
                 This only applies if your have multiple services which have been
                 assigned to different paths on the load balancer.
  DesiredCount:
    Type: Number
    Default: 2
    Description: How many copies of the service task to run

  Role:
    Type: String
    Default: ""
    Description: (Optional) An IAM role to give the service's containers if the code within needs to
